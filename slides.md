# Daim Digital

My Company, Daim Digital, is developing open-source digital experience platform to help startups solve a problem with building and managing an affordable digital marketing presence.

---

## Introduction

My name is Damien Robinson from Daim Digital, I'm here to promote the investment of your time mentoring me. I'm asking for ongoing support and help with building a sustainable business. I'm working with a handful of startups and small businesses to build out a portfolio and help me test the process of my business of building high quality bespoke marketing websites.

## Problem

WordPress and other website builders provides a terrible developer experience and are holding back technical innovate of the web.

Website builders are big, complicated technology platforms that are difficult to customise and tailor to brand style. They have a learning curve and force developers to compromise the quality of their output to work with the website builder tool.

Server side rendered websites like WordPress are not ideal for reliability and sustainability. They often have server scaling and hosting management headaches.

The website is the core of digital presence but that's one channel there are also email and social integrations required to reach those audiences. Off the shelf software never does integration smoothly.

"Content is King - Code is Queen ".

## Is there a ‘compelling’ need

Every business needs a website. Some businesses hire external Digital Agencies to build websites. Other businesses build websites themselves.

Every small business marketing website I have worked on have plenty of issues. Small businesses don't want to spend resources making the web a better place, they want a website that works.
---
## Solution

Innovate marketing websites built with bleeding-edge technology. Beautifully designed to provide a competitive digital presence for start-ups.

I'm automating the process of making personalised marketing websites. Automation reduces the time taken to deliver projects and makes the project cheaper to produce.

Nuxt is an innovating static site generation framework I use to build websites.

---

## Product

I use open source self-hosted software. If the maintainer abandons the project, I can find another, or I can fork the project and maintain it myself.

The core tool is Nuxt.js, an innovating static site generation framework I use to build websites.

I host websites on Cloudflare, but it can be any static or serverless hosting provider.

I use a bunch of other quality assurance tools such as Sentry and Google Lighthouse.

---

## Hypothesis

I'm working on testing my idea of automating innovative, high-quality marketing websites for startups.

Freelancers and Digital Agencies are out there doing similar work. Plenty of content manage systems out there try to do the same thing. I'm sure there's room in the market for another.

I've worked in content management my whole career and never found a tool that works for me.

---

## Market

My current niche is small business and more specifically startups. I love working with innovative people who want to change things for the better.

### Identified market and channel strategies

Utilising **social channels** to share content that would be relevant and helpful for entrepreneurs. Also connecting in person at **networking events, Co working spaces and start up incubators**.

---

## Team

I'm a rock star dev, where I often do more than half the work for my whole team. I build websites in 5 days that reach millions of users.

Problem is: There is only one of me, and I can't do everything. I would love to train some more junior developers to do cool stuff like me.

I work with a few freelance designers and other types of freelancers when they have more experience with something than I do.

I'm a web developer working 80-hour weeks for the last 5 years, building my skills in both business and technology with commercial full-time work and open-source contributions.

Being an entrepreneur myself, I can empathise with the needs of other entrepreneurs.

Passion for open source and collaboration allow me to make wonderful, long-lasting industry connections.

## The team’s experience and capabilities to execute

I'm a web developer working 80-hour weeks for the last 5 years, building my skills in both business and technology with commercial full-time work and open-source contributions.

I have built plenty of bespoke marketing websites for big brands like Tourism Queensland and Uber.

Passion for open source and collaboration allow me to make wonderful, long-lasting industry connections.

## Is the business lean, mean and able to ‘pivot’ with opportunities

As a sole trader, the business is small and since I'm bootstrapping I like to keep things low cost.

I can be pretty mean, I'm not a fan of how big companies get slow and complacent and constantly look for better ways to do their business.

Build working on a variety of projects, I'm always happy to change stuff up. I like to fail fast, so I can move onto the next project.

---

## Passion and commitment of founders to hang in during tough times

I don't think I will be walking away from my personal freelance branding.

I have worked plenty of tough agency jobs where I've been on call and called back into the office in the middle of the night to fix emergencies. Furthermore, I'm uncertain if there is much out there that would turn me away at this point.

---

## Financial

I like to keep costs low, and usually open-source projects can be run for free unless you want to pay the open-source developers. Which I do since it makes the community more sustainable.

---

## Competition

There are millions of Digital Agencies building bespoke software every day. I'm just another average everyday developer looking to fill the capacity with the 2 jobs for every developer.

There are also thousands of content management systems, several of them I have built for other agencies. None of them have worked quite right for me, but that's what I'm looking to change.

The 2 types of alternatives are, do it yourself (DIY) website builders and hiring a digital agency to do it for you.

- WordPress (43% market share)
- Square Space
- Wix
- Shopify
- Bubble
- Webflow
- Plenty of Digital Agencies

---

## Ask

Bootstrapping the business and looking for mentoring rather than funding.

Looking forward to working with the startup community to deliver high quality digital experiences. I invite you to please give your feedback.

---

## Go To Market

Startups have reached out to me looking to work with an English-speaking developer that can effectively communicate with them and get their website to work for them, rather than them working for the website.

I plan to work face to face with startups in River City Labs to build and maintain outstanding digital marketing experiences.

---
## Business Model
