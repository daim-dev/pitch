## Introduction

<!--
Who am I?
What am I looking for?
What am I doing?

TODO: more about me aspiring entrepreneur. passions
 -->

I'm Damien Robinson an aspiring entrepreneur and web developer.

My start up is Daim Digital

I'm working with small businesses and startups, to my portfolio and refine my skills in building high quality bespoke marketing websites.

I'm asking for mentorship and ongoing support with building a sustainable business.

To help me automate and streamline the process and scale to help other businesses.

---

## Story

### Why am I doing this?

I want more freedom to build innovative and sustainable software. I have a passion for building well designed web sites and content management systems.

### Whats my story?

For the last 5 years I have worked in digital agencies building bespoke landing pages and marketing websites for big and small brands. My favorite project is Scuber.

### Problems?

Existing Content management systems are difficult for developers to use. The systems are designed to improve the efficiency of content editors rather than helping developers to quickly create and maintain websites.

### Capabilities?

Nuxt.js Open source contributor

Marketing automation tool builder

---

## The team’s experience and capabilities to execute

I'm a web developer working 80-hour weeks for the last 5 years, building my skills in both business and technology with commercial full-time work and open-source contributions.

I have built plenty of bespoke marketing websites for big brands such as Tourism Queensland and Uber.

Passion for open source and collaboration allow me to make wonderful, long-lasting industry connections.

---

## Problem

TODO: tell story make positive. why people choose a developer for a custom bespoke website and why I'm building tools to speed the process up.

WordPress and other website builders provides a terrible developer experience and are holding back technical innovate of the web.

Website builders are big, complicated technology platforms that are difficult to customise and tailor to brand style. They have a learning curve and force developers to compromise the quality of their output to work with the website builder tool.

Server side rendered websites like WordPress are not ideal for reliability and sustainability. They often have server scaling and hosting management headaches.

The website is the core of digital presence but that's one channel there are also email and social integrations required to reach those audiences. Off the shelf software never does integration smoothly.

---

## Is there a ‘compelling’ need

TODO: kill or merge with product

Every business needs a website. Some businesses hire external Digital Agencies to build websites. Other businesses build websites themselves.

Every small business marketing website I have worked on have plenty of issues. Small businesses don't want to spend resources making the web a better place, they want a website that works.

---

## Hypothesis

I'm testing my idea of automating innovative, high-quality marketing websites for startups. By working with startups and building marketing websites I can identify patterns for streamlining the process with automation.

Freelancers and Digital Agencies are doing similar work including digital marketing agencies I have worked for. The product of digital agencies, content manage systems try to do the same thing.

I've worked in content management my whole career and never found a tool that works for me. I'm working to build tools that scratch my own itch.

## Solution

I want to streamline and automate the process of optimising websites and providing bespoke marketing digital experiences.

I also want to provide these open source tools to small businesses and startups and grow a community. To help further scale their businesses.

<!--
Innovate marketing websites built with bleeding-edge technology. Beautifully designed to provide a competitive digital presence for start-ups.

I'm automating the process of making personalised marketing websites. Automation reduces the time taken to deliver projects and makes the project cheaper to produce.

Nuxt is an innovating static site generation framework I use to build websites.

## Tools

Preferably Open source Self-hosted

|                    |              |
| ------------------ | ------------ |
| Frontend           | Nuxt.js      |
| Backend            | Laravel PHP  |
| Database           | Postgres SQL |
| Hosting            | Google Cloud |
| CDN                | Cloudflare   |
| Image optimization | Cloudinary   |
| Error Monitoring   | Sentry       |

<!--
The core tool is Nuxt.js, an innovative static site generation framework I use to build websites.

I host websites on Cloudflare, the worlds largest network provider.

I use a bunch of other quality assurance tools such as Sentry and Google Lighthouse.

This combination of innovative tooling provide a good developer and user experience.

# Unfair Advantage

## **Open Source**

Examples:

- Supabase
- Sentry

<!--
# My unfair advantage

## Open source community

Building a tool for developers first experience and making it open source allows tinkerers to jump in and contribute.

Allowing people to self host the software is a feature. It's great that other people can own and fully control the code they use.

Companies such as Supabase and Sentry are open source, you can host it yourself, but its still raising money and people pay them for the cloud hosted version. This is a great example of open source working profitably.

 -->

## Market

Solo founders and small teams with multiple projects who are time poor.

- Startups
- Small business

<!--
My current niche is small business and more specifically startups. I love working with innovative people who want to change things for the better.

Each small business is unique and need a custom touch to help differentiate them from the compotation.

Why am I targeting startups? Founders value their time and don't always have the ability to outsource development work. As a solo founder I know there is only one of me and any streamlining to allow for more clients is a must.

My experience working with small businesses shows they quickly get to a stage where they have outgrown the limitations of the above competition but are not making enough revenue to hire digital agencies. This is where both freelancers and automation tools come in: offering both cost and time efficient alternatives.

# Channels

- River City Labs
- Social Media and Website

Connecting in person at **networking events, Co working spaces and start up incubators** such as River City Labs.

Utilising **social channels** to share content that would be relevant and helpful for entrepreneurs.

<!--

How do I reach startups?

Utilising **social channels** to share content that would be relevant and helpful for entrepreneurs. Also connecting in person at **networking events, Co working spaces and start up incubators** such as River City Labs.

Embedding myself in the startup community will present organic opportunities to help founders.

I can only network with a few founders in person at a time.

Using my own marketing tools to generate organic digital marketing presence will help reach more founders.

Writing and sharing interesting articles with founders will help build a relationship with founders.

# Competition

::left::

## The 2 types of alternatives are

1. **Do it yourself (DIY)** website builders
1. Hiring a digital agency to **do it for you**

::right::

## Examples

- WordPress (43% market share)
- Square Space
- Wix
- Shopify
- Bubble
- Webflow
- Freelancers
- Digital Agencies

<!--
Digital Agencies build bespoke software every day. Over the last 5 years I've worked at digital agencies building bespoke landing pages.

Thousands of content management systems, several of them I have built for other agencies. None of them have worked right for me, but that's what I'm looking to change.

-->

---

# Business Model

## Professional services

- Software development
- Web design and development
- Organic Search Optimisation
- Messaging (Email, SMS)
- Support (on call, after hours)

## Software setup and maintenance

- Server setup and hosting
- Reselling third party software

<!--
I'm freelancing at a rate of $98 an hour with packages for projects and retainer-based services. Moving forward, the goal is to use value-based pricing to promote building better products rather than worrying about time sheets.

Working face to face with startups in River City Labs to build and maintain outstanding digital marketing experiences. Each bespoke marketing website project I build I'm able to cross pollinate projects and share reusable components.

Startups have reached out to me looking to work with an English-speaking developer that can effectively communicate with them and get their website to work for them, rather than them working for the website.

## Success metrics

Measuring how engaging a web page, and how the page is creating revenue generating leads and conversions.

- Impressions
- Page views
- Page load speed
- Time on page
- Contact form submissions
- Customer Conversions

<!--
Metrics are important for any business and as part of the product analytics get built in.

Measuring how engaging a web page, and how the page is creating revenue generating leads and conversions, is an important part of showing value.

Value based pricing needs metrics to prove where the value is coming from.
 -->

## Goals

In the next 12 months I want to:

- Work full time for myself
- Learn how to run a sustainable business
- Help startups
- Build outstanding digital marketing experiences
- Show results that beat industry benchmarks
- Value-based revenue and pricing

<!--
My main goal is to strike out on my own with the freedom and independence of working for myself.

My secondary goals are to help others build their dream business and make their business work for them rather than them working for the business.

I can see an abundance of opportunities to learn new things along the way.

I'm working full time at a digital agency maintaining a custom CMS for government infrastructure contractors to communicate upcoming tunneling works.
 -->

---

## Financial

Not a billion dollar idea.
Looking for advice on how to reach my market

I'm bootstrapping the business and looking for mentoring rather than funding.

I like to keep costs low, and usually open-source projects can be run for free unless you want to pay the open-source developers. Which I do since it makes the community more sustainable.

---

# Ask

- ## Mentorship
- ## Community
- ## Accountability

<!--
# What am I looking to get out of an Accelerator program?

## Mentorship
What kind of mentor am I looking for?

Someone that can help me build a sustainable business that collaborates with the start up community.

## Community

Being a founder is lonely, I can get much further working with other than I can ever possibly achieve on my own.

## Accountability

Working with others and meeting milestones will help keep me on track to reach my goals.


How can I reach people who are going through process of building a startup?

How to scale businesses to reach more people?

How to meet demands of getting more clients?

-->

## Thanks

I'm looking forward to working with the startup community to deliver high quality digital experiences.

Thanks for your time. I invite you to please give your feedback.
