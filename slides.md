# Daim Digital

My Company, Daim Digital, is developing an open-source digital experience platform to help startups solve a problem: building and managing an affordable digital marketing presence.

---

## Introduction

My name is Damien Robinson from Daim Digital, 

TODO: more about me aspiring entrepreneur. passions

I'm asking for mentorship and ongoing support with building a sustainable business.

My market is fellow small businesses and startups, who I'm targeting to help me build my portfolio and refine my skills in building high quality bespoke marketing websites.

TODO: So I can automate and streamline the process and scale this to other businesses.

---

## Story

Why am I doing this?

Whats my story?

Problems?

capabilities?

---

## Problem

TODO: tell story make positive. why people choose a developer for a custom bespoke website and why I am building tools to speed the process up.

WordPress and other website builders provides a terrible developer experience and are holding back technical innovate of the web.

Website builders are big, complicated technology platforms that are difficult to customise and tailor to brand style. They have a learning curve and force developers to compromise the quality of their output to work with the website builder tool.

Server side rendered websites like WordPress are not ideal for reliability and sustainability. They often have server scaling and hosting management headaches.

The website is the core of digital presence but that's one channel there are also email and social integrations required to reach those audiences. Off the shelf software never does integration smoothly.

---

## Is there a ‘compelling’ need

TODO: kill or merge with product

Every business needs a website. Some businesses hire external Digital Agencies to build websites. Other businesses build websites themselves.

Every small business marketing website I have worked on have plenty of issues. Small businesses don't want to spend resources making the web a better place, they want a website that works.

---

## Solution

TODO: I want to streamline and automate the process of optimising websites and providing bespoke marketing digital experiences.

I also want to provide these tools open source to fellow small businesses and startups and grow a community. Who can further scale their businesses.

<!-- Innovate marketing websites built with bleeding-edge technology. Beautifully designed to provide a competitive digital presence for start-ups.

I'm automating the process of making personalised marketing websites. Automation reduces the time taken to deliver projects and makes the project cheaper to produce.

Nuxt is an innovating static site generation framework I use to build websites. -->

---

## Tools

I use open source self-hosted software. If the maintainer abandons the project, I can find another, or I can fork the project and maintain it myself.

The core tool is Nuxt.js, an innovating static site generation framework I use to build websites.

I host websites on Cloudflare, but it can be any static or serverless hosting provider.

I use a bunch of other quality assurance tools such as Sentry and Google Lighthouse.

---

## Hypothesis

<!-- Redundant -->

I'm working on testing my idea of automating innovative, high-quality marketing websites for startups.

Freelancers and Digital Agencies are out there doing similar work. Plenty of content manage systems out there try to do the same thing. I'm sure there's room in the market for another.

I've worked in content management my whole career and never found a tool that works for me.

---

## Market

My current niche is small business and more specifically startups. I love working with innovative people who want to change things for the better.

Why am I targeting startups? My fellow founders value their time and don't always have the ability to outsource development work. As a solo founder I know there is only one of me and any streamlining to allow for more clients is a must.

TODO: My experience working with (SME) shows they're at a stage where they have outgrown the limitations of the above competition but are not making enough revenue to hire digital agencies. This is where both freelancers and automation tools come in: offering both cost and time efficient alternatives.

---

## Identified market and channel strategies

How do I reach startups?

Utilising **social channels** to share content that would be relevant and helpful for entrepreneurs. Also connecting in person at **networking events, Co working spaces and start up incubators**.

---

## The team’s experience and capabilities to execute

TODO: move this to the background or the story behind my business

I'm a web developer working 80-hour weeks for the last 5 years, building my skills in both business and technology with commercial full-time work and open-source contributions.

I have built plenty of bespoke marketing websites for big brands like Tourism Queensland and Uber.

Passion for open source and collaboration allow me to make wonderful, long-lasting industry connections.

---

## Competition

There are millions of Digital Agencies building bespoke software every day. I'm just another average everyday developer looking to fill the capacity with the 2 jobs for every developer.

There are also thousands of content management systems, several of them I have built for other agencies. None of them have worked quite right for me, but that's what I'm looking to change.

The 2 types of alternatives are, do it yourself (DIY) website builders and hiring a digital agency to do it for you.

- WordPress (43% market share)
- Square Space
- Wix
- Shopify
- Bubble
- Webflow
- Plenty of Digital Agencies

---

## Go To Market

TODO: make positive or kill

Startups have reached out to me looking to work with an English-speaking developer that can effectively communicate with them and get their website to work for them, rather than them working for the website.

I plan to work face to face with startups in River City Labs to build and maintain outstanding digital marketing experiences.

---
## Business Model

I'm working on freelancing with an hourly rate of $98 working on service packages for projects and retainer-based services. Moving forward, the goal is to use value-based pricing to promote building better products rather than worrying about timesheets.

---

- Developer $1,000 - $5,000 per project (10 - 50 hours)
- Project Manager $200 per project
- Domain name $20 - $400 per year
- Server Hosting $20 - $4000 per month

## Total
$3,240 - $14,400 per project

---

## Success metrics
Measuring how engaging a web page, and how the page is creating revenue generating leads and conversions.

- Impressions
- Page views
- Page load speed
- Time on page
- Contact form submissions

---
## How much of your own funds committed to date

Based on the hours I spent writing code in it, which is in the hundreds of hours combined with my hourly rate at $98.

200 x 98 = 19,600

Also, a 2 thousand dollars of capitalisation for assets and other costs setting up the business.

Total $22,600 AUD

## Goals

TODO: more specific. Goals

until I can support myself full time

- Help startups
- do cool digital marketing
- show results against an industry benchmark.
- value-based revenue 
- work full time for myself.

---

## Financial

TODO: move financial to ask page

Not a billion dollar idea.
Looking for advice on how to reach my market

I like to keep costs low, and usually open-source projects can be run for free unless you want to pay the open-source developers. Which I do since it makes the community more sustainable.

---

## Ask

TODO: move financial to here.
What kind of mentor am I looking for? My ideals of open source and automation.
Looking to reach people like me and how to scale my business to reach more people. How to meet demands of getting more clients.

Bootstrapping the business and looking for mentoring rather than funding.

Looking forward to working with the startup community to deliver high quality digital experiences. I invite you to please give your feedback.
